## Deploying the CrowdSale Contracts

**1.	Set the network as Kovan**

**2.	Deploy CrowdSale Contract**

After compiling the files, we deploy the Pupper Coin CrowdSale Deployer
* We determine the name and symbol of the coin, the wallet behind it as well as the initial supply and the goal, which is set to be the same as the cap.

After hitting confirm in MetaMax, we have successfully deployed the contract with the various contracts that, after being deployed, will allow us to create the coin and make coin sales.


**3.	Deploy Pupper Coin Contract**

From the contract deployed in the prior step we will use the token address generated to input in this step.

**4.	Deploy Pupper Coin Sale Contract**

From the first contract deployed, we will use the token sale address generated to input in this step.

## Buying ARGIE

**1.Buying the New Coin at the Crowd Sale**
We will buy from a different account to the account that created the coin, 0.05 ETH + 1 WEI to hit the goal and bet the ranch.

And this is how we successfully sold 0.05 ETH (less than the required amount but due to limited ETH available in the multiple accounts) of ARGIE.
